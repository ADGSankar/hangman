You can have one site per GitHub repository. Repositories other than "username.github.io" will be published at http://username.github.io/REPONAME. Those repositories will publish whatever you push to the "gh-pages" branch.

A better description is available in the GitHub Pages documentation.

(since April 2013, all username.github.com are now username.github.io)
